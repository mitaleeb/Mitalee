for (int i = 0; i<=10; i++){
}

while (condition){

}



do {

{
while (condition)

For do while loops it will do it atleast once which can be used for infinite loops in gaming.

switch statements syntax:
switch (condition (usually a variable) ) 
{
	case condition1: 
		do stuff
		break;
	case condition 2:
		do stuff
		break;
	default:
		stuff 
		break;
}

break statements exit out of the switch statement once a 
case becomes true, it exits the switch statement entirely.
If the case is false it goes on to the next one. Always
add break statements.

Default statements are like "else" statements.
